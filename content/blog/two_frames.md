DevOps and Serverless, two frames for making sense of the waves of change in IT.

Moving beyond a modernist organizational concept, large enterprises and start-ups alike are no longer simply asking “can this be automated (the modernist conception)” but are instead turning towards understanding “what it will mean when this is automated”.

After a brief introduction of the modern management concept (industrialization) and a quick review of the various conceptions of capital (capital, human, social), this talk will use each of the frames to point towards issues that contemporary IT organizations will need to grapple with in the near future.
