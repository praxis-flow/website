Jabe Bloom and Benjamin Mosior sit down to chat about Transactionality vs Reciprocity in organization.

The increased negotiating that takes place in transactional contexts can create local optima, where one group can "succeed" at the expense of the entire system. On the other hand, a belief that "in the end someone will make this right" reduces the negotiating in organizations with lots of reciprocity, enabling it to "flow" easily into different kinds of situations.
